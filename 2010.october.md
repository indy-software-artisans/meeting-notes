# October Admin Meeting

## Action Items
* Dean will follow up with Larry about MID - they have no chairs or tables
* Jon will book Nov/Dec with MM2
* Jon will email Shane to email Infragistics about which months we used MM2 so we can get reimbursed. (via Ryan, since May)

## Old Business
* Shane will send Infragistics the email to see if they'll pay for us (medium:32:$75/$50, large:60-75:$100)
* Jon to tell Tim Kanban is what we want.
* Franklin was a bust.

### Locations
1. Shane will send a confused email to Infragistics and see what is up with the money situation.

### Incorporation (again)
1. Dean will ask his father-in-law about doing our taxes... if we want to incorporate.
1. Mike, Ryan will look into what this will really cost us.  We'll expect real numbers here for next meeting. And all the stuff we might need to do to make this happen.
