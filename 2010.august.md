## Old Business

### Locations
1. Shane will send a confused email to Infragistics and see what is up with the money situation.

### Incorporation (again)

## New Business

### September Meeting
* Jon to do his MongoDB talk, maybe add some couch goodness (Jon to talk to Brett and Matt and Shawn about Couch, maybe one of the Ruby guys)
